# My Solution for first 4 levels
aircraft has 3 "stages":
- Turning towards the circles tangent 
- locking into the circle
- spinning around the circle

In my opinion shortest way to land is by getting to the circle
which has tangent parallel to landing direction( and center on normal of the landing direction)


It's hard to explain but watch the picture
watch the image /python/demo.png
